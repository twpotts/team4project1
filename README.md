Employee 
The employee size in this study population was distributed well with 26-100, 100-500, and 
more than 1000 employees. Each of these groups had 50o or more employees. Employee 
size 500-100 and 25 and under was less representative. 
Sample Counts 
The sample counts for the years decreased each year. The highest was in 2016 with 1413. 
The lowest was the most recent year - 2019 which consisted of a count of 352 (a little more 
than 75%). 
Gender 
Out of the 2958 cases, 41%  (1237) said that they had a mental health disorder. The study 
was male dominated. In this study, the men outnumbered the women by 42%. The males 
represented 69.6% of the sample with 59.7% of the mental health disorders. The women 
represented 26.7% of the sample with 35.2% of the mental health disorders. There is a 
higher percentage of woman who report having a mental health disorder.  
The biggest percentage of mental health disorders with tech workers occurred in 2018 with 
45.8%. The data also suggests that the more employees that a company has, the larger 
number of employees with mental health disorders. 
Age 
When the data is compared by age, the 60+ age group has the highest number of 
individuals with mental disorders and the 20’s age group ranks second. Females are higher 
in each age group except the 50’s and 60’s. The 50’s are equal and the 60’s have more 
males with mental health disorders. 
Country 
The data reveals varying degrees of mental health importance across countries, With 
particular emphasis on the United States. This shows elements such as mental health 
treatment access and public interest efforts likely contribute to the spreading of mental 
health issues within the United States. Comparing to other countries featured in this 
dataset can further clarify the relative importance and scale of the issue within the 
United States. This reveals disparities in mental health awareness and access to 
resources for mental illness across different nations. 
Negative consequences 
we can identify trends and patterns related to negative consequences for co-workers 
with mental health issues, These consequences might include discrimination, 
stigmatization, career setbacks, or lack of support from management and colleagues. 
We can provide a subtle understanding of the prevalence and nature of negative 
consequences associated with mental health issues in the workplace, as reported by 
survey participants across multiple years.
