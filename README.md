Employee:

The employee size in this study population was distributed well with 26-100, 100-500, and more than 1000 employees. Each of these groups had 50o or more employees. Employee size 500-100 and 25 and under was less representative.

Sample Counts:

The sample counts for the years decreased each year. The highest was in 2016 with 1413. The lowest was the most recent year - 2019 which consisted of a count of 352 (a little more than 75%). As far as covid circumstances it could’ve increased, years 2020 to 2024 had a low data set due to covid.

Gender:

Out of the 2958 cases, 41% (1237) said that they had a mental health disorder. The study was male dominated. In this study, the men outnumbered the women by 42%. The males represented 69.6% of the sample with 59.7% of the mental health disorders. The women represented 26.7% of the sample with 35.2% of the mental health disorders. There is a higher percentage of woman who report having a mental health disorder.
The biggest percentage of mental health disorders with tech workers occurred in 2018 with 45.8%. The data also suggests that the more employees that a company has, the larger number of employees with mental health disorders.

Age:

When the data is compared by age, the 60+ age group has the highest number of individuals with mental disorders and the 20’s age group ranks second. Females are higher in each age group except the 50’s and 60’s. The 50’s are equal and the 60’s have more males with mental health disorders.

Country: 

The data reveals varying degrees of mental health importance across countries, With particular emphasis on the United States. This shows elements such as mental health treatment access and public interest efforts likely contribute to the spreading of mental health issues within the United States. Comparing to other countries featured in this dataset can further clarify the relative importance and scale of the issue within the United States. This reveals disparities in mental health awareness and access to resources for mental illness across different nations.

Negative consequences:

We can identify trends and patterns related to negative consequences for co-workers with mental health issues, These consequences might include discrimination, stigmatization, career setbacks, or lack of support from management and colleagues. We can provide a subtle understanding of the prevalence and nature of negative consequences associated with mental health issues in the workplace, as reported by survey participants across multiple years.

Summary:

Mental health in the tech industry has increasingly become a focal point of discussion globally, especially after the pandemic.  Some of the findings during our project included:

1.	High-pressure environments: The tech industry is notorious for its fast-paced, high-pressure environment. Long hours, tight deadlines, and intense competition can contribute to stress, anxiety, and burnout among employees.  This issue does not discriminate by country, gender or age.

2.	Culture of overwork: Many tech companies have a culture of overwork, where employees feel pressured to work long hours and sacrifice personal time for the sake of their jobs. This can lead to exhaustion and negatively impact mental well-being.  (The I want it now effect)

3.	Isolation and loneliness: Despite being connected digitally, many tech workers report feelings of isolation and loneliness, especially if they work remotely or in roles that require a lot of independent work. Lack of social interaction can exacerbate mental health issues.  A trend of returning to the office has been noticed to curb this and to belong to a team again.

4.	Stigma around mental health: Despite growing awareness, stigma around mental health still exists in the tech industry. Employees may fear disclosing their struggles due to concerns about job security or being perceived as weak.  Reliability becomes a crucial value and many mental health issues can be swept under the rug, to in essence “remain valuable”.

5.	Efforts to address mental health: Some tech companies are starting to prioritize mental health and well-being initiatives. This includes offering employee assistance programs, mental health days, mindfulness and meditation sessions, and promoting work-life balance.  

6.	Remote work challenges: The shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic presented new challenges for mental health in the tech industry. Blurred boundaries between work and personal life, feelings of isolation, and increased screen time have all impacted mental well-being.  Management challenges and disciplinary actions increase due to a not knowing about mental health issue that are caused.

Overall, while the tech industry has made strides in addressing mental health issues, there is still much work to be done to create supportive and healthy work environments for all employees.
